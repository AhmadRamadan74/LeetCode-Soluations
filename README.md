# 📘 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to a wide range of **LeetCode problems**, solved mainly using **C++** (with some JavaScript where applicable).  
The purpose of this repository is to practice **data structures and algorithms**, improve problem-solving skills, and track performance over time.

Most solutions are automatically synchronized using **LeetSync**, which preserves submission history, runtime, and memory usage.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory using the following format:

problem-number-problem-name/
│── solution file(s)
│── README.md (optional explanation)


Example:

1-two-sum/
20-valid-parentheses/
70-climbing-stairs/
347-top-k-frequent-elements/


Folder names follow the official **LeetCode problem numbering** for easy navigation.

## ⚙️ Performance Tracking

For many problems, the repository includes:

- ⏱ Runtime performance (milliseconds and percentile)
- 💾 Memory usage (megabytes and percentile)
- 🕒 Submission date

This helps evaluate efficiency and compare different solutions.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen algorithm and data structure knowledge  
- Prepare for **technical interviews**  
- Maintain a clean archive of solved problems  
- Track progress and optimization improvements  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add detailed explanations for complex problems  
- Include optimized and alternative solutions  
- Organize problems by difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)
